Poetry is the one thing you own; it is the bird in your hand “Hymn of Nature” by Felicia Dorothea Hemans appears in the anthologyThe Young Lady’s Offering; Or Gems of Prose and Poetry(Phillips, Sampson & Company, 1851). In her article, “Hemans, Wordsworth, and the ‘Literary Lady’” (Victorian Poetry, Fall 1997, Vol. 35, No. 3), professor of English at Saint Mary’s University Deborah Kennedy wrote: “The contradictory nature of the life of the nineteenth-century woman poet can be effectively illustrated by the literary and personal relationship between Felicia Hemans andWilliam Wordsworth, two of the most popular poets of the Victorian period. […] Wordsworth disliked Hemans’s ‘too elaborate and studied conversation,’ which he found characteristic of ‘many literary ladies.’ It is possible that she seemed to him ‘elaborate and studied’ because she did not conceal her learning and spoke with the authority of her publicly recognized position rather than showing a proper female deference.” O! Blest art thou whose steps may roveThrough the green paths of vale and groveOr, leaving all their charms below,Climb the wild mountain’s airy brow! And gaze afar o’er cultur’d plains,And cities with their stately fanes,And forests, that beneath thee lie,And ocean mingling with the sky. For man can show thee nought so fair,As Nature’s varied marvels there;And if thy pure and artless breastCan feel their grandeur, thou art blest! For thee the stream in beauty flows,For thee the gale of summer blows;And, in deep glen and wood-walk free,Voices of joy still breathe for thee. But happier far, if then thy soulCan soar to Him who made the whole,If to thine eye the simplest flowerPortray His bounty and His power: If, in whate’er is bright or grand,Thy mind can trace His viewless hand,If Nature’s music bid thee raiseThysong of gratitude and praise; If heaven and earth with beauty fraught,Lead to His throne thy raptured thought;If there thou lovest His love to read;Then, wand’rer, thou art blest indeed! This poem is in the public domain. Published in Poem-a-Day on March 9, 2025, by the Academy of American Poets. 4 poems Come, boys, sing!—Sing of the yellow corn, One does such work as one will not,And well each knows the right;Though the white storm howls, or the sun is hot,The black must serve the white.And it’s, oh, for the white man’s softening flesh,While the black man’s muscles grow!Well I know which grows the mightier, O, rich young lord, thou ridest byWith looks of high disdain;It chafes me not thy title high,Thy blood of oldest strain.The lady riding at thy sideIs but in name thy promised bride.Ride on, young lord, ride on! I’m in my room writingspeaking in myself& I hear youmove down the hallwayto water your plants I write truth on the pageI strike the word over & overyet I worry you’ll pour too much water on the plants& the water will overflow onto the booksruining them If I can’t speak out of myselfhow can I tell you I don’t care about the plants?how can I tell you I don’t care if the books get wet? 5 poets The 2010 winner of the National Book Award in poetry, Terrance Hayes is the author of seven poetry collections.

These fine poems, written at different times and from a variety of perspectives, all look hard at the landscapes they enshrine. The Poetry Archive is the only charity wholly dedicated to the production, acquisition and preservation of recordings of significant poets reading their work aloud. We care for and preserve these uniquely valuable voices, which might otherwise be lost, so that future generations can continue to enjoy them. We make our own recordings of poets who write in the English language, and poets also donate copies of their own archives to us so we can look after them in the long term. Hearing how a poet speaks their own poems brings us a deeper level of understanding and enjoyment of the work and provides a rich resource for poetry lovers, explorers, teachers and students of all ages. We have a fundamental belief that poetry is for everyone so, as a charity, the funds we raise are used to record new poets and keep sharing these wonderful collections free-of-charge with you. Ismael Mansoor is a Deaf Poet, he was the British Deaf Association’s BSL Poet Laureate (2024-2025). This World Book Day, the Poetry Archive invites you to celebrate the magic of reading with a collection of poems that explore its power to transport, transform, and inspire. These poems capture the deep and personal relationship between words and… Poetry that overtly uses the effects of metre, rhyme and form, especially the fixed forms (sonnets, villanelles etc) is known as formal verse. Good examples in the Archive include the extract from Fred D'Aguiar's 'Bloodlines', written in ottava rima, Mimi Khalvati's tight quatrains in 'Don't Ask Me, Love, For That First Love', or Dylan Thomas' 'A Refusal to Mourn the Death, By Fire, Of A Child in London', in which the poet has invented a set of formal restrictions that he adheres to. Its opposite, strictly, is free verse. Many poets, however, can and do operate in both free and formal ways in their work, and sometimes within the one poem. A classic example of this is T S Eliot's 'The Waste Land', which moves between blank verse and free verse, and shifts in and out of rhyming. Felix Dennis writes almost entirely in formal verse. byCharles Causley byJack Underwood bySimon Armitage byFlora de Falbe by Charles Causley by Jack Underwood by Simon Armitage by Flora de Falbe We’re always adding to the Poetry Archive so sign up to our newsletter to keep up to date with the latest archive news, events and releases.

Arthur Parnassus, once a ward of the Department in Charge of Magical Youth, has transformed his trauma into a sanctuary for magical orphans who, like him, have been marginalized by society. Among them are a gnome, a pixie, a shapeshifter, and Lucy, the son of Satan. When Arthur is summoned to testify about his past, he hopes to prevent other children from enduring similar pain. However, the hearing proves to be a farce, jeopardizing the joyful life he and his partner, Linus Baker, have built on the island. As the Department sends an inspector to audit the orphanage, they secretly welcome a new unregistered magical orphan who boldly embraces his identity as a monster. Together, Arthur, Linus, and their children must unite to protect their family and fight for their rights. Narrated by Daniel Henning, the characters come alive with humor and compassion. You can’t help but fall in love with Arthur and his family as you cheer for their triumph over fear and prejudice. Each character possesses a distinct voice that makes them feel incredibly relatable. While this book is aimed at adults, older teens who enjoyedMiss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, the work of Aiden Thomas orGreenglass Housewill likely find it a perfect fit. –Jeannine Everett The Selected Lists teams read throughout the year in search of the best titles published in their respective categories. Once a book is suggested (either internally or through the title suggestion form), it must pass through a review process to be designated an official nomination. Each week, the teams feature a review of one of the officially nominated titles. Additional titles to receive this designation are listed as well. At year’s end, the team will curate a final list from all nominated titles and select a Top Ten. In a land where witches are ruthlessly hunted and killed, Rune Winters, secretly known as the Crimson Moth and a witch herself, spends her nights clandestinely saving witches, smuggling them to safety while, by day, maintaining her reputation of a superficial socialite. Having lost his family to witches, Gideon Sharpe became a captain in the Blood Guard, a militaristic group that hunts witches, and is determined to take down the crimson moth at any cost. Believing her to be a flighty socialite but also the key to finding the Crimson Moth, Gideon must pretend to be interested in Rune. In order to save Seraphine, a powerful witch, recently imprisoned, Rune must pretend to be interested in Gideon. As the two get closer to their goals and to discovering each other’s secrets, the danger of their deceptions escalate when their feelings become real. Filled with scenes of intense romance and heart pounding near misses this is an enthralling, serpentine novel that readers will not be able to put down. With strong world building, the story is told in third person narration, each chapter alternating focus on Rune and Gideon. Both areengaging, complex, sympathetic protagonists that come with a fully fleshed out cast of supporting characters. While the enemies to lovers trope is common, teens will gobble up this romantasy and eagerly await the sequel. Hand this to teens who enjoy watching Shadow and Bone, the Witcher or A Discovery of Witches. A great choice for teens looking for fantasy, suspense and/or romance as this one ticks all the boxes! Similar titles include:Six of Crowsby Leigh Bardugo,The Cruel Princeby Holly Black andSerpent & Doveby Shelby Mahurin –Karen T. Bilton In 1941, thirteen-year-old Japanese-American Amy is sent to Japan to visit her dying great-grandmother. When she first arrives, she struggles to understand her family’s Japanese, but in time she adapts and becomes accustomed to even her sosobo’s strong country accent. She develops a kinship with her Japanese family, especially her sosobo, Ama, who tells her about her youth as a pearl diver in Okinawa. This gentle connection with her extended family is interrupted when Japan bombs Pearl Harbor, and Amy becomes trapped in Japan, a nisei, or American Born. Taken from her family, she is assigned to be a translator in Hiroshima, betraying the country of her birth. But when she receives a letter from home, confirming the rumors she and the other nisei translators have heard about America’s treatment of Japanese Americans, she wonders who betrayed whom. Smith’s writing beautifully captures Amy’s search for identity, which is magnified by the conflict of World War II. At the heart of the story is the tender intergenerational relationship between Amy and Ama. Their will to survive changes out of their control serves as a tether between them. Norrie’s blue-toned illustrations show this gentle family connection, but also strikingly portray the dark violence of the destruction of Hiroshima. This moving story of survival will appeal to readers who enjoy historical fiction with strong female characters, like those by Elizabeth Wein, Sharon Cameron, and Ruta Sepetys. Teens who enjoyed learning about the treatment of Japanese Americans during World War II in books likeWe Are Not Freeby Traci Chee orDisplacementby Kiku Hughes will be interested in learning about an American’s experience in Japan during the war. –Patricia Jimenez During World War II, Bletchley Park, known by its codename Station X, was a top-secret center in Britain dedicated to cracking Nazi codes. Young women, often teenagers, arrived with little understanding of their role, yet they quickly became vital to the operation. Tasked with running complex machines, deciphering wireless transmissions, and sorting intelligence, they worked alongside renowned cryptographers to produce information critical to the war effort. These young women’s aptitude for secrecy and specialized skills proved instrumental in supporting the Allies’ success. The Enigma Girlsby Candace Fleming is a compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates the real-life contributions of young women codebreakers at Bletchley Park during World War II. Narrator Moira Quirk lends gravitas to the story, capturing the suspense and importance of their secret work while keeping listeners fully engaged. Though it reads like fiction, the story is all the more powerful and captivating because it recounts true events. For teens captivated byThe Enigma Girls, comparable titles include Candace Fleming’sThe Rise and Fall of Charles Lindbergh, another meticulously researched biography highlighting influential figures in history. Other engaging nonfiction options includeImpossible Escapeby Steve Sheinkin,We Had to Be Braveby Deborah Hopkinson, andAttacked!: Pearl Harbor and the Day War Came to Americaby Marc Favreau, each detailing gripping moments of courage during wartime. For fans of historical fiction, teens should try Jennifer A. Nielsen’s novels,ResistanceandRescue, which bring to life stories of resilience and bravery during World War II. -Lorrie Roussin The Selected Lists teams read throughout the year in search of the best titles published in their respective categories. Once a book is suggested (either internally or through the title suggestion form), it must pass through a review process to be designated an official nomination. Each week, the teams feature a review of one of the officially nominated titles. Additional titles to receive this designation are listed as well. At year’s end, the team will curate a final list from all nominated titles and select a Top Ten. Nick and Charlie, now admitting they are in love, worry about taking their relationship to the next level. Nick leaves for a trip with his fellow seniors to tour universities as he attempts to make decisions about his future. Charlie continues to struggle with disordered eating, and to be himself without Nick. With Nick leaving next year for university, they struggle with how potential distance will affect them. This installment of theHeartstopperseries is just as engaging, accessible, and relatable as the previous four. The representation and characterization of the cast are sincere, and the world of these teens feels genuine. The art style is simplistic, yet sweet and emotive. Teens will appreciate the gravity given to the romantic relationships, as the author clearly takes them seriously, lending them an earned maturity complete with communication breakdowns and repairs. Teens looking for romance with realistic stakes or sincere gay representation will love this book. Fans of earlier books in the series or the Netflix show will find the latest installment equally enjoyable. Fans of Rainbow Rowell’sCarry Onseries, David Levithan’s novels, andWhat If It’s Usby Becky Albertalli and Adam Silvera will likewise enjoy this book. ––Dakota Hall Sixteen-year-old, Amina Conteh clashes with her religious father in many ways, and is forced to spend more time at their church because of her rebellious ways. When she is assaulted by a church leader, Amina uses poetry to find her voice and seek justice for what happened to her and to what has happened to other girls in the congregation. This book is an incredibly powerful novel in verse that captures the ripped-from-the-headlines pain of a young sexual assault survivor working to seek justice in a world where it is so often denied. The growth of the relationship with her father is well done and different than what is normally depicted with young adult/parent relationships. The ending is cathartic and pays off well for all the readers who find themselves getting hooked and living through every poem and page. Teen readers that enjoy novels in verse, introspective poetry, fast-paced, and authentic realistic fiction will find this book appealing. Fans ofGrownby Tiffany D. Jackson,Muted by Tami Charles, andRedby Ani Cardi will appreciate the similar story lines, but with another offering of unique storytelling and an ending that still sets it apart from the rest. –Molly Dettmann The Selected Lists teams read throughout the year in search of the best titles published in their respective categories.

The story centers around Grace Mendes, a college student grappling with low self-esteem and the shadows of her past. With a fierce alter ego named Cinderhella, she embarks on a transformative journey that combines humor, heart, and action. Cooke brilliantly captures the essence of Grace’s struggles–from her complicated relationship with her stepmother to the bullying that results from her newfound celebrity. With her best friend Callie supporting her to step outside her comfort zone, Grace discovers the liberating thrill of pillow fighting– a sport that subverts traditional stereotypes and offers a fresh take on female empowerment. The playful names of the competitors, like Kat Atonic and Rapunchel, add a delightful pun-filled charm that evokes roller derby and professional wrestling. Mel Valentine Vargas’s bold color palette enhances the on-page action. It highlights the diverse cast of characters that enrich the story with varied experiences and perspectives on sexuality, gender, and race. At its core,Pillow Talkis an action-packed coming-of-age tale that emphasizes friendship, self-acceptance, and the importance of lifting each other up. Fans ofHockey Girl Loves Drama Boywill appreciate its energetic storytelling. This story offers a window (or a mirror) into a young woman’s struggle to maintain a healthy relationship with her body, similar toFat Chance, Charlie Vega. Those familiar withLara Dean Keeps Breaking Up With Mewill identify the journey to embrace their true selves. –Patricia Jimenez Mary is a mermaid on a mission to rule the high seas. Heartbroken and stranded on a pirate ship, she seizes the chance to join the crew—though singing shanties isn’t enough for her. With an eye on the captain’s hat, Mary is determined to make waves and prove her worth as more than a “little” mermaid. When the notorious Blackbeard meets an untimely end, Mary’s journey takes a daring turn as she aims not just for captaincy, but for the throne of Pirate King—or Queen! This adventurous fantasy novel reimaginesThe Little Mermaidwith a bold, swashbuckling twist, blending elements of pirate lore and mermaid mythology in a high-stakes tale of ambition and courage. The story’s playful and spirited tone keeps readers hooked as Mary, the “mermaid captain,” fights for her place in a world of pirates and legends. The narrator, Nneka Okoye, skillfully varies tone and pitch, creating engaging character distinctions that enhance the story’s vibrant and adventurous spirit, making each scene come alive. Comparable titles includeDaughter of the Pirate Kingby Tricia Levenseller, which shares a fierce, ambitious heroine navigating life at sea, andTo Kill a Kingdomby Alexandra Christo, a darkly adventurous twist onThe Little Mermaidmyth. For a cinematic comparison,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearlcaptures a similar swashbuckling tone and high-seas adventure, with characters challenging conventions and striving for power. –Lorrie Roussin The Selected Lists teams read throughout the year in search of the best titles published in their respective categories.

At year’s end, the team will curate a final list from all nominated titles and select a Top Ten. This graphic novel memoir shares the journey of Theo as they find out more about themself. The author beautifully captures their experience – and relates it to the idea of creating home and sanctuary – before they arrive at the term nonbinary, which feels like home to them. This title has instant appeal to teens – and not only those who might be traveling a similar journey to the one Theo is on. Any teen who is grappling with fitting in, identity , or gender would be able to relate to this book. The format makes this memoir very accessible to reluctant readers. Teens who have enjoyed readingGender Queerby Maia Kobabe andThe Princess and the Grilled Cheese Sandwichby Deya Muniz will enjoy this graphic memoir. –Katie Guzan Bella shared a secret with her beloved grandma, Laurel: every so often they share a glass of something “sweet” over a game of Scrabble. Now that Laurel has passed, Bella is finding herself taking the edge off the anxiety of warring parents, a needy younger sister, a job, her broken heart after an unwanted break up, and academic demands with her bottle of Sprodka–a mixture of Sprite and vodka in the unassuming Sprite bottle. The problem is, her reliance on her Sprodka is increasing and her memory of its aftermath is decreasing. When she loses control at a party and mixes recreational drugs with her alcohol, her “friends” leave her on her mother’s doorstep where Bella falls and nearly dies. After a stint at a rehab facility, Bella must try to pick up the pieces of her life. Kathleen Glasgow established herself as a credible voice in realistic fiction withGirl in Pieces, so this is a title with a built in readership, and Bella’s story does not disappoint. Glasgow writes from a place of personal experience using a plot inhabited by realistically flawed characters. The inclusion of Bella’s internal monologue ratchets up the reader’s sense of her anxiety while Glasgow’s portrayal of a loving, but dysfunctional, family and the social dynamics of high school are immediately recognizable. Despite the bleakness of the subject matter, this is ultimately a story of hope and healing that ends on the precipice of Bella’s success. Teens who are on their own journeys to sobriety will find a lot to love about this plot. Not quite as gritty as Jas Hammond’sThirsty, it will scratch the same itch. Bella’s recovery via nature is similar to Wren’s in Wendelin Van Draanen’sWild Bird, and shares some similarity to Mia’s path in Jessie Ann Foley’sYou Know I’m No Good. – Jodi Kruse Each week, the teams feature a review of one of the officially nominated titles.

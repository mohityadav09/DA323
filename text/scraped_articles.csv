After more than a year of laying low, Billie, Helen, Mary Alice and Natalie are called back into action. When they receive a summons from the head of the elite assassin organization known as the Museum, they are ready to tackle the greatest challenge of their careers. Someone on the inside has compiled a list of important kills committed by Museum agents, connected to a single, shadowy figure, an Eastern European gangster with an iron fist, some serious criminal ambition, and a tendency to kill first and ask questions later. This new nemesis is murdering agents who got in the way of their power-hungry plans, and the aging quartet of killers is next. Together the foursome embark on a wild ride across the globe on the double mission of rooting out the Museum’s mole and hunting down the gangster who seems to know their next move before they make it. Betty MacDonald was a 28-year-old reporter from Hawaii. Zuzka Lauwers grew up in a tiny Czechoslovakian village and knew five languages by the time she was 21. Jane Smith-Hutton was the wife of a naval attaché living in Tokyo. Marlene Dietrich, the German-American actress and singer, was one of the biggest stars of the 20th century. As members of the OSS during World War II, their task was to create a secret brand of propaganda produced with the sole aim to break the morale of Axis soldiers. Betty, Zuzka, Jane and Marlene forged letters and “official” military orders, wrote and produced entire newspapers, scripted radio broadcasts and songs, and even developed rumors for undercover spies and double agents to spread to the enemy. And outside of a small group of spies, no one knew they existed. Until now. Ward D is the hospital's mental health unit, and as a medical student, Amy is required to gain experience on the floor. But little do her colleagues know that it may force her to confront a past she has fought hard to forget. The night starts. The countdown begins. As the hours tick by, Amy grows increasingly convinced that something terrible is happening within the ward's tightly secured walls. When patients and staff start to vanish without a trace, it becomes clear that everyone on the unit is in grave danger. Amy never wanted to spend the night on Ward D. Now she might not make it out alive. It's July 1992, and the Troubles in Northern Ireland are still grinding on after 25 apocalyptic years. Detective Inspector Sean Duffy got his family safely over the water to Scotland, to ""Shortbread Land."" Duffy is a part-timer now, only returning to Belfast six days a month to get his pension. It's an easy gig, if he can keep his head down. But then a murder case falls into his lap while his protege is on holiday in Spain. A carjacking gone wrong and the death of a solitary, middle-aged painter. But something is not right, and as Duffy probes, he discovers that the painter was an IRA assassin. So the question becomes: Who hit the hitman, and why? This is Duffy's most violent and dangerous case yet, and the whole future of the burgeoning ""peace process"" may depend upon it. No one is more sympathetic than a mother whose child faces a life-threatening illness. But what if the mother is the cause of the illness? What if the sympathy is the point? Munchausen by proxy (MBP) has fascinated and horrified both professionals and the general public since this disturbing form of child abuse was first identified. But even as the public has been captivated by these tales of abuse and deception, there remains widespread misinformation and confusion about MBP. Are these mothers unfeeling psychopaths, or sick women who need help? And how can we protect the children whose lives are at stake? THE MOTHER NEXT DOOR offers a groundbreaking look at MBP from an unlikely duo: a Seattle novelist whose own family was torn apart by it, and the Texas detective who has worked on more medical child abuse cases than anyone in the nation. In 26 sparkling essays, illuminated through both text and image, celebrated author and artist A. Kendra Greene is trying to make sense of the things that matter most in life: love, connection, death, grief, the universe, meaning, nothingness and everythingness. Through a series of encounters with strangers, children and animals, the wild merges with the domestic; the everyday meets the sublime. Each essay returns readers to our smallest moments and our largest ones in a book that makes us realize --- through its exuberant language, playful curation and delightful associative leapfrogging --- that they are, in fact, one and the same. For the past 18 years, Ivy Gordon has been the most famous star at the Dollhouse Academy, the elite boarding school and talent incubator that every aspiring performer dreams of attending. But in secret diary entries, she begins to reveal the truth of her life at the Dollhouse: strange medical exams, mysterious supplements, and something unspeakable that has left her terrified and feeling like a prisoner. Ramona Halloway and her best friend, Grace Ludlow, grew up idolizing Ivy. Neither has made much headway in showbiz until a lucky break grants them entry to the Dollhouse. When Ramona begins to receive threatening anonymous messages, it’s easy to dismiss them as a prank from a rival. Her bigger concern is Grace’s skyrocketing success. But as the messages grow more unsettling, so does life at the Dollhouse. As the smoke from Canadian wildfires chokes Detroit, PI Amos Walker is tasked with investigating a fatal hit-and-run. The victim is Spencer Bennett, a junior law associate with the Waterford Group, and he supposedly had a file of confidential documents on him when he died. But those documents have now gone missing, and the firm is dead set on Walker finding them. As Walker digs deeper into the events leading to Bennett's death, all signs are pointing towards the crash being anything but accidental. Summer in Detroit was hot enough before the smoke descended, but as the temperature rises and more bodies crop up in connection to the missing file, Walker will have to track down those documents --- and unearth why they were worth killing over --- before it's too late. Grief-stricken over her mother’s death and bruised by her failure on her most recent case, Special Agent Emmeline Helliwell with the National Park Service returns to her Utah hometown to heal and regroup. She’s determined to turn in her badge and take over her mother’s bakery for a much quieter life…until the body of a childhood friend turns up in The Narrows of Zion National Park. The case is too personal for Emme to turn down, but the seemingly simple investigation turns treacherous as clues that connect to her previous case grow too glaring to ignore. When bodies start to pile up, Emme must track down the killer before they take more lives, venturing deep into Zion National Park to uncover the sordid secrets hiding beneath its stunning beauty.

Poetry,poets.org | Academy of American Poets,2025-03-09,https://www.poets.org,"Poetry is the one thing you own; it is the bird in your hand “Hymn of Nature” by Felicia Dorothea Hemans appears in the anthologyThe Young Lady’s Offering; Or Gems of Prose and Poetry(Phillips, Sampson & Company, 1851). In her article, “Hemans, Wordsworth, and the ‘Literary Lady’” (Victorian Poetry, Fall 1997, Vol. 35, No. 3), professor of English at Saint Mary’s University Deborah Kennedy wrote: “The contradictory nature of the life of the nineteenth-century woman poet can be effectively illustrated by the literary and personal relationship between Felicia Hemans andWilliam Wordsworth, two of the most popular poets of the Victorian period. […] Wordsworth disliked Hemans’s ‘too elaborate and studied conversation,’ which he found characteristic of ‘many literary ladies.’ It is possible that she seemed to him ‘elaborate and studied’ because she did not conceal her learning and spoke with the authority of her publicly recognized position rather than showing a proper female deference.” O! Blest art thou whose steps may roveThrough the green paths of vale and groveOr, leaving all their charms below,Climb the wild mountain’s airy brow! And gaze afar o’er cultur’d plains,And cities with their stately fanes,And forests, that beneath thee lie,And ocean mingling with the sky. For man can show thee nought so fair,As Nature’s varied marvels there;And if thy pure and artless breastCan feel their grandeur, thou art blest! For thee the stream in beauty flows,For thee the gale of summer blows;And, in deep glen and wood-walk free,Voices of joy still breathe for thee. But happier far, if then thy soulCan soar to Him who made the whole,If to thine eye the simplest flowerPortray His bounty and His power: If, in whate’er is bright or grand,Thy mind can trace His viewless hand,If Nature’s music bid thee raiseThysong of gratitude and praise; If heaven and earth with beauty fraught,Lead to His throne thy raptured thought;If there thou lovest His love to read;Then, wand’rer, thou art blest indeed! This poem is in the public domain. Published in Poem-a-Day on March 9, 2025, by the Academy of American Poets. 4 poems Come, boys, sing!—Sing of the yellow corn, One does such work as one will not,And well each knows the right;Though the white storm howls, or the sun is hot,The black must serve the white.And it’s, oh, for the white man’s softening flesh,While the black man’s muscles grow!Well I know which grows the mightier, O, rich young lord, thou ridest byWith looks of high disdain;It chafes me not thy title high,Thy blood of oldest strain.The lady riding at thy sideIs but in name thy promised bride.Ride on, young lord, ride on!

Poetry,Poetry Archive,2025-03-09,https://www.poetryarchive.org,"These fine poems, written at different times and from a variety of perspectives, all look hard at the landscapes they enshrine. The Poetry Archive is the only charity wholly dedicated to the production, acquisition and preservation of recordings of significant poets reading their work aloud. We care for and preserve these uniquely valuable voices, which might otherwise be lost, so that future generations can continue to enjoy them. We make our own recordings of poets who write in the English language, and poets also donate copies of their own archives to us so we can look after them in the long term. Hearing how a poet speaks their own poems brings us a deeper level of understanding and enjoyment of the work and provides a rich resource for poetry lovers, explorers, teachers and students of all ages. We have a fundamental belief that poetry is for everyone so, as a charity, the funds we raise are used to record new poets and keep sharing these wonderful collections free-of-charge with you. Ismael Mansoor is a Deaf Poet, he was the British Deaf Association’s BSL Poet Laureate (2024-2025). This World Book Day, the Poetry Archive invites you to celebrate the magic of reading with a collection of poems that explore its power to transport, transform, and inspire. These poems capture the deep and personal relationship between words and… What free verse claims to be free from is the constraints of regular metre and fixed forms. This makes the poem free to find its own shape according to what the poet - or the poem - wants to say, but still allows him or her to use rhyme, alliteration, rhythms or cadences (etc) to achieve the effects that s/he feels are appropriate. There is an implicit constraint, however, to resist a regular metre in free verse - a run of a regular metre will stand out awkwardly in an otherwise free poem. Sometimes known as vers libre, free verse has a long pedigree and is very common in contemporary poetry. Yet there are still voices that claim poetry is only poetry when it is formal verse, and would agree with Robert Frost who, when asked about free verse, said ""I'd just as soon play tennis with the net down"". Fans of free verse can counter with T S Eliot's insistence that ""no vers is libre for the man who wants to do a good job"" - the net may be down, but this allows a poet (of either gender) to play to different rules. Simon Armitage's 'You're Beautiful', for example, creates for himself a set of rules that includes repeated words at the starts of phrases, rather than a structure of repeated sounds at the end of lines. 'What Is Poetry', by John Ashbery, is a good example of free verse - it has neither regular metre nor rhyme, but the exploration of the title's question contains effects based on rhythm and repetition. byWole Soyinka bySharon Olds bySeamus Heaney byAhren Warner by Wole Soyinka by Sharon Olds by Seamus Heaney by Ahren Warner We’re always adding to the Poetry Archive so sign up to our newsletter to keep up to date with the latest archive news, events and releases.

Arthur Parnassus, once a ward of the Department in Charge of Magical Youth, has transformed his trauma into a sanctuary for magical orphans who, like him, have been marginalized by society. Among them are a gnome, a pixie, a shapeshifter, and Lucy, the son of Satan. When Arthur is summoned to testify about his past, he hopes to prevent other children from enduring similar pain. However, the hearing proves to be a farce, jeopardizing the joyful life he and his partner, Linus Baker, have built on the island. As the Department sends an inspector to audit the orphanage, they secretly welcome a new unregistered magical orphan who boldly embraces his identity as a monster. Together, Arthur, Linus, and their children must unite to protect their family and fight for their rights. Narrated by Daniel Henning, the characters come alive with humor and compassion. You can’t help but fall in love with Arthur and his family as you cheer for their triumph over fear and prejudice. Each character possesses a distinct voice that makes them feel incredibly relatable. While this book is aimed at adults, older teens who enjoyedMiss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, the work of Aiden Thomas orGreenglass Housewill likely find it a perfect fit. –Jeannine Everett The Selected Lists teams read throughout the year in search of the best titles published in their respective categories. Once a book is suggested (either internally or through the title suggestion form), it must pass through a review process to be designated an official nomination. Each week, the teams feature a review of one of the officially nominated titles. Additional titles to receive this designation are listed as well. At year’s end, the team will curate a final list from all nominated titles and select a Top Ten. In a land where witches are ruthlessly hunted and killed, Rune Winters, secretly known as the Crimson Moth and a witch herself, spends her nights clandestinely saving witches, smuggling them to safety while, by day, maintaining her reputation of a superficial socialite. Having lost his family to witches, Gideon Sharpe became a captain in the Blood Guard, a militaristic group that hunts witches, and is determined to take down the crimson moth at any cost. Believing her to be a flighty socialite but also the key to finding the Crimson Moth, Gideon must pretend to be interested in Rune. In order to save Seraphine, a powerful witch, recently imprisoned, Rune must pretend to be interested in Gideon. As the two get closer to their goals and to discovering each other’s secrets, the danger of their deceptions escalate when their feelings become real. Filled with scenes of intense romance and heart pounding near misses this is an enthralling, serpentine novel that readers will not be able to put down. With strong world building, the story is told in third person narration, each chapter alternating focus on Rune and Gideon. Both areengaging, complex, sympathetic protagonists that come with a fully fleshed out cast of supporting characters. While the enemies to lovers trope is common, teens will gobble up this romantasy and eagerly await the sequel. Hand this to teens who enjoy watching Shadow and Bone, the Witcher or A Discovery of Witches. A great choice for teens looking for fantasy, suspense and/or romance as this one ticks all the boxes! Similar titles include:Six of Crowsby Leigh Bardugo,The Cruel Princeby Holly Black andSerpent & Doveby Shelby Mahurin –Karen T. Bilton In 1941, thirteen-year-old Japanese-American Amy is sent to Japan to visit her dying great-grandmother. When she first arrives, she struggles to understand her family’s Japanese, but in time she adapts and becomes accustomed to even her sosobo’s strong country accent. She develops a kinship with her Japanese family, especially her sosobo, Ama, who tells her about her youth as a pearl diver in Okinawa. This gentle connection with her extended family is interrupted when Japan bombs Pearl Harbor, and Amy becomes trapped in Japan, a nisei, or American Born. Taken from her family, she is assigned to be a translator in Hiroshima, betraying the country of her birth. But when she receives a letter from home, confirming the rumors she and the other nisei translators have heard about America’s treatment of Japanese Americans, she wonders who betrayed whom. Smith’s writing beautifully captures Amy’s search for identity, which is magnified by the conflict of World War II. At the heart of the story is the tender intergenerational relationship between Amy and Ama. Their will to survive changes out of their control serves as a tether between them. Norrie’s blue-toned illustrations show this gentle family connection, but also strikingly portray the dark violence of the destruction of Hiroshima. This moving story of survival will appeal to readers who enjoy historical fiction with strong female characters, like those by Elizabeth Wein, Sharon Cameron, and Ruta Sepetys. Teens who enjoyed learning about the treatment of Japanese Americans during World War II in books likeWe Are Not Freeby Traci Chee orDisplacementby Kiku Hughes will be interested in learning about an American’s experience in Japan during the war. –Patricia Jimenez During World War II, Bletchley Park, known by its codename Station X, was a top-secret center in Britain dedicated to cracking Nazi codes. Young women, often teenagers, arrived with little understanding of their role, yet they quickly became vital to the operation. Tasked with running complex machines, deciphering wireless transmissions, and sorting intelligence, they worked alongside renowned cryptographers to produce information critical to the war effort. These young women’s aptitude for secrecy and specialized skills proved instrumental in supporting the Allies’ success. The Enigma Girlsby Candace Fleming is a compelling work of nonfiction that illuminates the real-life contributions of young women codebreakers at Bletchley Park during World War II. Narrator Moira Quirk lends gravitas to the story, capturing the suspense and importance of their secret work while keeping listeners fully engaged. Though it reads like fiction, the story is all the more powerful and captivating because it recounts true events. For teens captivated byThe Enigma Girls, comparable titles include Candace Fleming’sThe Rise and Fall of Charles Lindbergh, another meticulously researched biography highlighting influential figures in history. Other engaging nonfiction options includeImpossible Escapeby Steve Sheinkin,We Had to Be Braveby Deborah Hopkinson, andAttacked!: Pearl Harbor and the Day War Came to Americaby Marc Favreau, each detailing gripping moments of courage during wartime. For fans of historical fiction, teens should try Jennifer A. Nielsen’s novels,ResistanceandRescue, which bring to life stories of resilience and bravery during World War II. -Lorrie Roussin The Selected Lists teams read throughout the year in search of the best titles published in their respective categories. Once a book is suggested (either internally or through the title suggestion form), it must pass through a review process to be designated an official nomination. Each week, the teams feature a review of one of the officially nominated titles. Additional titles to receive this designation are listed as well. At year’s end, the team will curate a final list from all nominated titles and select a Top Ten. Nick and Charlie, now admitting they are in love, worry about taking their relationship to the next level. Nick leaves for a trip with his fellow seniors to tour universities as he attempts to make decisions about his future. Charlie continues to struggle with disordered eating, and to be himself without Nick. With Nick leaving next year for university, they struggle with how potential distance will affect them. This installment of theHeartstopperseries is just as engaging, accessible, and relatable as the previous four. The representation and characterization of the cast are sincere, and the world of these teens feels genuine. The art style is simplistic, yet sweet and emotive. Teens will appreciate the gravity given to the romantic relationships, as the author clearly takes them seriously, lending them an earned maturity complete with communication breakdowns and repairs. Teens looking for romance with realistic stakes or sincere gay representation will love this book. Fans of earlier books in the series or the Netflix show will find the latest installment equally enjoyable. Fans of Rainbow Rowell’sCarry Onseries, David Levithan’s novels, andWhat If It’s Usby Becky Albertalli and Adam Silvera will likewise enjoy this book. ––Dakota Hall Sixteen-year-old, Amina Conteh clashes with her religious father in many ways, and is forced to spend more time at their church because of her rebellious ways. When she is assaulted by a church leader, Amina uses poetry to find her voice and seek justice for what happened to her and to what has happened to other girls in the congregation. This book is an incredibly powerful novel in verse that captures the ripped-from-the-headlines pain of a young sexual assault survivor working to seek justice in a world where it is so often denied. The growth of the relationship with her father is well done and different than what is normally depicted with young adult/parent relationships. The ending is cathartic and pays off well for all the readers who find themselves getting hooked and living through every poem and page. Teen readers that enjoy novels in verse, introspective poetry, fast-paced, and authentic realistic fiction will find this book appealing. Fans ofGrownby Tiffany D. Jackson,Muted by Tami Charles, andRedby Ani Cardi will appreciate the similar story lines, but with another offering of unique storytelling and an ending that still sets it apart from the rest. –Molly Dettmann The Selected Lists teams read throughout the year in search of the best titles published in their respective categories.

Teen librarians are encouraged to share theList of Potential Nomineesunder consideration with their patrons and solicit feedback using the link:https://bit.ly/BFYA25TeenFB Stephanie Cooke’sPillow Fightis a vibrant and empowering graphic novel that invites readers into the exhilarating world of competitive pillow fighting. The story centers around Grace Mendes, a college student grappling with low self-esteem and the shadows of her past. With a fierce alter ego named Cinderhella, she embarks on a transformative journey that combines humor, heart, and action. Cooke brilliantly captures the essence of Grace’s struggles–from her complicated relationship with her stepmother to the bullying that results from her newfound celebrity. With her best friend Callie supporting her to step outside her comfort zone, Grace discovers the liberating thrill of pillow fighting– a sport that subverts traditional stereotypes and offers a fresh take on female empowerment. The playful names of the competitors, like Kat Atonic and Rapunchel, add a delightful pun-filled charm that evokes roller derby and professional wrestling. Mel Valentine Vargas’s bold color palette enhances the on-page action. It highlights the diverse cast of characters that enrich the story with varied experiences and perspectives on sexuality, gender, and race. At its core,Pillow Talkis an action-packed coming-of-age tale that emphasizes friendship, self-acceptance, and the importance of lifting each other up. Fans ofHockey Girl Loves Drama Boywill appreciate its energetic storytelling. This story offers a window (or a mirror) into a young woman’s struggle to maintain a healthy relationship with her body, similar toFat Chance, Charlie Vega. Those familiar withLara Dean Keeps Breaking Up With Mewill identify the journey to embrace their true selves. –Patricia Jimenez Mary is a mermaid on a mission to rule the high seas. Heartbroken and stranded on a pirate ship, she seizes the chance to join the crew—though singing shanties isn’t enough for her. With an eye on the captain’s hat, Mary is determined to make waves and prove her worth as more than a “little” mermaid. When the notorious Blackbeard meets an untimely end, Mary’s journey takes a daring turn as she aims not just for captaincy, but for the throne of Pirate King—or Queen! This adventurous fantasy novel reimaginesThe Little Mermaidwith a bold, swashbuckling twist, blending elements of pirate lore and mermaid mythology in a high-stakes tale of ambition and courage. The story’s playful and spirited tone keeps readers hooked as Mary, the “mermaid captain,” fights for her place in a world of pirates and legends. The narrator, Nneka Okoye, skillfully varies tone and pitch, creating engaging character distinctions that enhance the story’s vibrant and adventurous spirit, making each scene come alive. Comparable titles includeDaughter of the Pirate Kingby Tricia Levenseller, which shares a fierce, ambitious heroine navigating life at sea, andTo Kill a Kingdomby Alexandra Christo, a darkly adventurous twist onThe Little Mermaidmyth. For a cinematic comparison,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearlcaptures a similar swashbuckling tone and high-seas adventure, with characters challenging conventions and striving for power. –Lorrie Roussin The Selected Lists teams read throughout the year in search of the best titles published in their respective categories. Once a book is suggested (either internally or through the title suggestion form), it must pass through a review process to be designated an official nomination. Each week, the teams feature a review of one of the officially nominated titles. Additional titles to receive this designation are listed as well. At year’s end, the team will curate a final list from all nominated titles and select a Top Ten. This graphic novel memoir shares the journey of Theo as they find out more about themself. The author beautifully captures their experience – and relates it to the idea of creating home and sanctuary – before they arrive at the term nonbinary, which feels like home to them. This title has instant appeal to teens – and not only those who might be traveling a similar journey to the one Theo is on. Any teen who is grappling with fitting in, identity , or gender would be able to relate to this book. The format makes this memoir very accessible to reluctant readers. Teens who have enjoyed readingGender Queerby Maia Kobabe andThe Princess and the Grilled Cheese Sandwichby Deya Muniz will enjoy this graphic memoir. –Katie Guzan Bella shared a secret with her beloved grandma, Laurel: every so often they share a glass of something “sweet” over a game of Scrabble. Now that Laurel has passed, Bella is finding herself taking the edge off the anxiety of warring parents, a needy younger sister, a job, her broken heart after an unwanted break up, and academic demands with her bottle of Sprodka–a mixture of Sprite and vodka in the unassuming Sprite bottle. The problem is, her reliance on her Sprodka is increasing and her memory of its aftermath is decreasing. When she loses control at a party and mixes recreational drugs with her alcohol, her “friends” leave her on her mother’s doorstep where Bella falls and nearly dies. After a stint at a rehab facility, Bella must try to pick up the pieces of her life. Kathleen Glasgow established herself as a credible voice in realistic fiction withGirl in Pieces, so this is a title with a built in readership, and Bella’s story does not disappoint. Glasgow writes from a place of personal experience using a plot inhabited by realistically flawed characters. The inclusion of Bella’s internal monologue ratchets up the reader’s sense of her anxiety while Glasgow’s portrayal of a loving, but dysfunctional, family and the social dynamics of high school are immediately recognizable. Despite the bleakness of the subject matter, this is ultimately a story of hope and healing that ends on the precipice of Bella’s success. Teens who are on their own journeys to sobriety will find a lot to love about this plot. Not quite as gritty as Jas Hammond’sThirsty, it will scratch the same itch. Bella’s recovery via nature is similar to Wren’s in Wendelin Van Draanen’sWild Bird, and shares some similarity to Mia’s path in Jessie Ann Foley’sYou Know I’m No Good. – Jodi Kruse Each week, the teams feature a review of one of the officially nominated titles. Additional titles to receive this designation are listed as well. At year’s end, the team will curate a final list from all nominated titles and select a Top Ten.The Best Fiction for Young Adults Committee appreciates teen feedback as members evaluate the nominated titles.
